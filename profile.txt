[box=About Me][centre][url=https://about.me/rmei]Some general interests[/url][/centre]
I started playing osu! and music game in general about 4 years ago, ten months after I came Canada. I've never dedicate playing osu!, and quit several times mostly because I suck at the game and I don't know what am I playing it for (I like music games nonetheless). After one year lived in Canada, I switched my interest to jubeat, a popular music game back then and reached to a decent level as a touchscreen player (but I still suck on arcade version). I quit jubeat one year ago because I feel like I am heading in the wrong way of approving myself, the game doesn't feel rewarding nor fun anymore. So I switched back to osu! and hope this time I could stay longer.
I took this nickname because back then I was a fan (in fact I'm not sure about being a fan or not, at least I watched a lot of related videos) of ¥¬¥Á¥à¥ÁÐÖÙF subculture. Now I would use Renko-Mei (with or without dash) as my alias. My mother language is Mandarin Chinese, I can also use Japanese, French, and intermediate level German. If you want mutual, feel free to PM me. I always forget in-game message (because I rarely get any).[/box]

Play focus: SS farming and shit passing, I don't retry for FC right now, it has to be the first try (of the day) FC[/list][/box]
[box=Abou SS farming]I've been doing SS ever since I started playing music game. I hate doing SS sometimes because it makes me frustrate, but I hate more for not getting SS when I really could. SS, or getting perfection in general, is like some kind of obsessive compulsive disorder, I just have to force myself to not to feel bad, even though I usually don't feel good about getting SS either, either because I am tired retrying or I feel that's just my routine job (what a bitch). Luckily enough, I am more patient than others on retrying. 
My best perfect score was on jubeat, Mutsuhiko Izumi - Red Goose[Easy], it was also my first jubeat EXC. I wasn't informed that if you don't plug in earphone or a charger then the static electricity will somehow make iPhone unable to perform multi-touch when two fingers are close to each other. I retried for a whole night (11 pm to 5 am?) on this single song, single difficulty, and I got it, I got EXC, that's the most stupid and most crazy thing ever happen in this world, and it won't definitely happen again.
But why am I farming SS then? After recently I joined back to osu!, one day I look at my folder and saw a blat amount of 1500 beatmaps. Damn, I said to my self, why don't I get SS on these maps and delete them? So my journey starts. I wasn't intent to use HDHRDT on every map, but it just feels better to apply 3 mods to those low star maps, no CS 2 circles which dominate your screen, no hypnotic AR 3, no stupid low AR approach circles, everything just feels so good. And from then I start to force my self to get at least 2 mod SS before deleting a map. I want the speed to delete as much beatmaps as I can so I usually don't play FL, but I want to get "perfection beyond perfection" as well (yea... why am I so stupid) so I apply mods. I have deleted 1500 or more maps after 6 months, but why do I have 3000 beatmaps now, this is so ******* unbelievable...
My rule of SS farming: HDHRDT, HDDT if base AR > 6 (resulting in AR > 10), FL if combo < 200 and I know it's not hard to do for me (for the most time it's pretty hard...), no HD if rhythm is awkward (i.e. I have to sight read constantly), AND there's no point in memorizing the rhythm if I can't get in top 50 (for example, the map has a shit ton of spinners and I see some guy with S rank and with better score than those who SS, and there are already 30 SS's on the map). If none of those above applies and still I can't SS, that just means I suck right now and I will try SS when I get better. I am also considering to only HDDT a AR 6 map with a lot of triplets or quintuplets because I can't actually read AR 9.96, my highest readable AR is only AR 9.5 or 9.6 and my age stops me from approving, but I will think about that latter.
My tip for HDHRDT: I don't think I am good enough to make tips, this SS farming is a thing that everyone can do but only a few cares about, and I am really the weak one among these SS farmers. If I have to list some, 1. alternating is a good way to reduce stress and the tension of your finger, 2. adjust your offset, if you have good music sense, in a lot of cases you should adjust your offset, rather than forcing yourself hit early or late through the map. Wise word from an elder Chinese [url=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EOI46Qly2Vk/hqdefault.jpg]Chi Long Qua[/url]: "there's nothing that can't be fixed with 1ms offset adjustment. If there is, then adjust 1 more ms". This is because: there're less effort put in timing adjustment for easier difficulties; different AR's and BPM's affect your sight read ability; physical and mental status also matter. Usually I have global offset (I only use global) +8ms , +4~6ms for high AR and high BPM, for 3 mod SS I've used from +4ms to +20ms, sounds pretty ridiculous right? 3. there are common patterns behind maps of each level. If you are good at duplets, then you should have some top 50 with HDHRDT, if you are good with triplets, triple stream, quintuplets, and quintuple stream, then you can get in to top 10 easily and don't need to read my advice lol, 4. feel the rhythm, this is a rhythm game, not a sightread trainning program. Understand which part of rhythm which the mapper want to follow, if you can't, at least have some kind of groove, or tempo, in your brain. 5. Don't stop retrying, and better retry the whole song if you choke often.[/box]
[box=Goals][list]Short term goal: 2000 SS and 500 top 50's, pass [url=https://osu.ppy.sh/s/484689]IAHN - Transform (Original Mix)[/url], fix 5 C score to B, fix 10 B score to A
Edit: I feel so tired of these SS farming, I might quit SS farming and start to learn higher AR, if I fail then I might switch to mapping. If I suck at everything then I just quit and enjoy my life as a software engineer (healthy life, feelsgoodman).
Longer term goal: 3000 SS, 1000 top 50's, top 20k, learn 3* map pattern (short, quick sliders and triplets intensive style), pass 5 7* maps
Ultimate goal for now: 5000 SS, 2000 top 50's, 4000 pp, a perma #1, and pass [url=https://osu.ppy.sh/s/411435]Billain - Boogie[/url]
Post heat-death goal: make real friend from osu! (I AM SERIOUS)
